========================
LAPTOP COSTUMER CARE 
========================

Project made for a Computer Engineering degree course, named Knowledge and Reasoning.
The main goal is to help picking a specific laptop according to the costumer's preferences using a paradigm model know as CBR (Case Based Reasoning).

This implemented system uses a myCBR project to generate similarities to the inputs and gives a list of the most similar laptop.
GUI is made in Java using Netbeans and myCBR API: http://mycbr-project.net/
To run the .prj file (myCBR project) follow the link of they're website

Any questions you can contact us via github available contact information.

========================
INSTRUCTIONS 
========================

- UNIX Distributions:
Double-click LaptopCC.jar
Warning: If whatever java runtime is not associated with jar files, this won't work. Solution: righ-click>open with>OpenJDK Java 7 Runtime (for example)
	       May need to change permissions to execute on Linux distributions.

- Windows
Double-click LaptopCC.jar

- To run the project from the command line, go to the dist folder and
type the following:
java -jar "LaptopCC.jar" 

- To run the project from Netbeans (recommended and actual project file) or eclipse you'll have to add CBR/myCBR3.0.1.jar to the project library.
   Attention: This Netbeans project isn't on this directory.

ADDITIONAL NOTES
========================

There's an ods file on CBR directory that contains all cases taken upon consideration onto this work.
